# Fraction class (C++ implementation)

A simple implementation of fractions, used to learn OOP in C++.

The Fraction class supports:
* addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (via operator overloading)
* simplification (2/4 -> 1/2)
* mixed numbers (eg. 5/2 == 2 1/2)

The Fraction class currently does not support:
* comparisons
* unit testing

A similar project [was written in Java](https://github.com/Kwpolska/fraction.java).

Usage (Unix): `make && ./fraction.out`
